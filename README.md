Open Realm of Stars is an open source 4X strategy game. Developed 
using Java. The game requires at minimum Swing and Java 7 to run.

Manage your planets gain access to better buildings and ships. Population management is key to acquiring more culture, research, metal and production.

### Have diplomacy with other space faring races

Make friends and enemies while traveling to outer realms. Form trade alliances, and defensive pacts to establish technology trade with other races. Make good diplomatic relations all other realms and win voting for ruler of the galaxy.

### Deep space combat
![](https://github.com/tuomount/Open-Realms-of-Stars/raw/master/ArtModification/screenshots/combat.png)

Fight enemies with customizable ship designs. Ship components have their own hit points and energy requirements to use them. Components will be rendered useless if hitpoints are depleted or energy requirements are not met. This makes space battles dynamic. A lucky shot by allied ship to an enemies fusion reactor will make them immobile on the battlefield. Fleets with advanced technologies have significant advantages, however luck or number of ships can sway the battle in your favor.

### Conquering the planets

Conquer enemy planets. Drop bombs to clear out enemy troops, then deploy your own ground troops to seize control.

### Leaders
![](https://github.com/tuomount/Open-Realms-of-Stars/raw/master/ArtModification/screenshots/leaders.png)

Each realm can have unique characters called leaders. These leaders can act as governors, fleet commanders and rulers. Each of the leader will gain perks which give bonus(negative or positive) on task they are performing. Leaders have limited life span and they will die for old age, but new ones can be replace the old one. Some rulers can have heirs which will eventually replace parents. These leaders can have also internal power struggles in certain government types.

### The history

After a game players are given a quick overview of major galactic events and how other realms did during the game. There will be also history events of all major events that leaders did during their time in the game.

## Warning about saved games working on newer version

Since Open Realms of Stars is still under development I cannot guarantee that
old saves will work for new versions. Backwards compatibility will
be broken when adding new features.

## Compiling the Project

Open Realm of Stars can be compiled with Maven.
Install maven and then run command:
``mvn install``

In the target directory a zip file contains all dependecies to run the Game.
Unzip, navigate to the newly extracted path and run ``Open-Realm-of-Stars-?.?.?.jar``
with following command ``java -jar Open-Realm-of-Stars-?.?.?.jar``. Note that the question
marks need to correspond to the correct build version.

Git project also contains an Eclipse project which should automatically compile it.
All java files under src folder needs to be compiled. Even when compiling Eclipse
run first maven command (``mvn install``) to fetch all the dependencies.

### Troubleshooting on compile

If you encounter following error while running command ``mvn install``:
``Error: Could not find or load main class org.apache.maven.surefire.booter.ForkedBooter``
it is due bug in certain OpenJDK or Oracle Java version. See more information on Launchpad:
https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/openjdk-8/+bug/1800792

Workaround is to use following command instead: (``mvn install -DforkCount=0``)

## Warning about using non stable version
Compiling non-stable releases is not recommended.
Non-stable versions of Open Realms of Stars may contain game breaking bugs that make the game unplayable.
The game is constantly being developed for and new features may introduce bugs.


If you encounter any critical bugs create a new issue for it. Use the stable release version, or wait for a new fix.
If you're interested in contributing to the project you are welcome to fix it. Contribution guidelines are outlined below.


## Running the game

Open Realms of Stars can be run from the Jar file or running compiled class.


## How to contribute

The simplest way to contribute to the project is to test out the game and if you encounter any bug raise an issue on the Git page. 
Please check to see if your issue has been posted before making new issue.

If you want to contribute code, fork the project and make the change. Be sure to add any unit tests where needed.
Run the code through JUnits and checkstyle before making a pull request. This can be done using ``mvn verify``.

### Guide lines for making pull requests
