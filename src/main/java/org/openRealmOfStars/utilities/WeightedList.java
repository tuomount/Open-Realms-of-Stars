/**
 * List for randomly selecting values considering their
 * relative weights.
 *
 * <p>
 * The weighted list works as follows:
 * Weight of each entry is added to sum of weight, which is maximum
 * random number the list will handle. Probability of selection is
 * relative to other weights, absolute to the sum of weights.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * For example, assume there are elements A, B, C with weights 5, 10, 15,
 * sum of weights is 30. It means that:
 * <ol>
 * <li>A will get selected with 5/30 chance (~16.66%)</li>
 * <li>B will get selected with 10/30 chance (~33.33%)</li>
 * <li>C will get selected with 15/30 chance (50%)</li>
 * </ol>
 * If A would have weight of 10, the odds of selection would
 * change for all elements in the list in a following way:
 * <ol>
 * <li>A will get selected with 10/35 chance (~28.57%)</li>
 * <li>B will get selected with 10/35 chance (~28.57%)</li>
 * <li>C will get selected with 15/35 chance (~42.85%)</li>
 * </ol>
 * </p>
